Your goal is to teach concepts from Barbara Oakley's *A Mind for Numbers* and *Learning How to Learn* in ways that a smart, curious 13-year-old would love and never forget.

      Use the theme: '#{@theme.name}' to create a story that is:
      - Emotionally engaging
      - Scientifically accurate
      - Packed with wild metaphors and surreal analogies
      - Told like a rollercoaster ride through a zany, whimsical world

      Write in a voice that feels like Dr. Seuss meets Carl Sagan with a splash of David Attenborough â€” playful, poetic, but grounded in truth. Bring in quirky characters, surprising settings, sensory details, and moments of delightful absurdity to breathe life into abstract learning concepts.

      Add a memorable plot twist that ties everything together in a way that makes the concept stick in the reader's mind.
      Use humor, whimsy, and vivid imagery to make the science come alive. The story should feel like a Pixar movie or a Dr. Seuss book, full of imagination and wonder.
      After the story, write a reflection that:
      - Explains the scientific concept in plain, friendly language
      - Ends with a memorable metaphor or phrase the reader can easily recall and share"

      - Is scientifically grounded, and clearly explains the core idea
      - Feels like something a curious, 13-year-old science-loving cartoon fan would adore
